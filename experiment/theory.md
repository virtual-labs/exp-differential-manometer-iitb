$$Fig. 1\ \ U\ Tube\ differential\ manometers$$

<p>In Fig. 1 (b), the two points A and B are at different level and also contains liquids of different sp. gr. These points are connected to the U-tube differential manometer. Let the pressure at A and B are P<sub>A</sub> and P<sub>B</sub></p>

<p>Let</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp; h = Difference of mercury level in the U-tube. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; y = Distance of the centre of B, from the mercury level in the right limb. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; x = Distance of the centre of A, from the mercury level in the right limb. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>1</sub> = Density of liquid at A. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>2</sub> = Density of liquid at B. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>g</sub> = Density of heavy liquid or mercury. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>Taking datum line at X-X.</p>

<p>Pressure above X-X in the left limb = &rho;<sub>1</sub>g(h + x) + P<sub>A</sub> <br>
where P<sub>A</sub> = pressure at A.</p>

<p>Pressure above X-X in the right limb = &rho;<sub>g</sub> &times; g &times; h + &rho;<sub>2</sub> &times; g &times; y + P<sub>B</sub> <br> 
where P<sub>B</sub> = Pressure at B.</p>

<p>Equating the two pressure, we have</p>

$$
\rho_1g(h + x) + P_A = \rho_g × g × h + \rho_2gy + P_B
$$

$$ ∴ \qquad \qquad P_A -P_B = \rho_g × g × h + \rho_2gy - \rho_1g(h+x) $$
$$ = h × g(\rho_g - \rho_1) + \rho_2gy - \rho_1gx \qquad \qquad \qquad ...equ(1) $$

$$ ∴\ \ Difference\ of\ pressure\ at\ A\ and\ B = h × g(\rho_g -\rho_1 ) + \rho_2gy - \rho_1gx $$

<p>In Fig. 1(a), the two points A and B are at the same level and contains the same liquid of density &rho;<sub>1</sub>. Then</p>

$$ Pressure\ above\ X-X\ in\ right\ \ limb = \rho_g × g × h + \rho_1 × g × x +P_B $$
$$ Pressure\ above\ X-X\ in\ left\ \ limb = \rho_1 × g × (h+x) + P_A $$

<p>Equating the two pressure</p>

$$ \rho_g × g × h + \rho_1gx +P_B = \rho_1 × g × (h+x) + P_A $$

$$ ∴ \qquad \qquad P_A - P_B = \rho_g × g × h + \rho_1gx - \rho_1g(h+x) $$
$$ = g × h(\rho_g - \rho_1) \qquad \qquad \qquad ...equ(2) $$
